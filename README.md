Computer scientists look for ways to create applications or systems that fulfil a need or goal. In the case of this specific material, computer scientists look for ways to use the cutting edge field of artificial intelligence and machine learning to find ways to enhance the abilites of these technologies and find ways to implement them that will benefit society as a whole.
As a computer scientist, I embrace learning about new technologies. I understand that knowing these technologies will benefit any project that I may work on in the future. It is important to plan, test, and secure any application or system that I am involved in building.
Ethically, it is important to ensure that all code is built in a sustainable, securable, and accurate way to protect the privacy, rights, and wellbeing of others. The GDPR provides a good foundation for ways to ensure that these areas of ethical concern are always kept in mind during code production and system development.
